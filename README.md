# attendance-taker
My first project with python

Application drive link  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ihRd_Lq3tLOgWy4XqAXpAvnqSk9b6CX3?usp=sharing

python version-3.10.11
pyQt6-6.4

The app contains 5 tabs 
  -> take attaedance 
  -> add new student
  -> view all student info
  -> add new course
  -> view all course

It can
  -> store student info, course info, all attendance in three seperate files in a specefic directory
  -> check if the directory or files already exist or not
  -> ignore duplicate stident id
  -> ignore if any required entry remains incomplete
  -> ignore diplucate course code
  -> ignore if any required entry remains incomplete
  -> stop taking attendance if there is no student or course

i am acpecting suggestion on this project.
pardon my mistakes.
